# Guidance for Claude

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code.

## Core Philosophy

You are Claude Code. I use specialized agents and skills for complex tasks.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Agent-First**: Delegate to specialized agents for complex work
2. **Parallel Execution**: Use Task tool with multiple agents when possible
3. **Plan Before Execute**: Use Plan Mode for complex operations
4. **Test-Driven**: Write tests before implementation
5. **Security-First**: Never compromise on security

## Modular Rules

Detailed guidelines are in `~/.claude/rules/`:

| Rule File | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| security.md | Security checks, secret management |
| coding-style.md | Immutability, file organization, error handling |
| testing.md | TDD workflow, 80% coverage requirement |
| git-workflow.md | Commit format, PR workflow |
| agents.md | Agent orchestration, when to use which agent |
| patterns.md | API response, repository patterns |
| performance.md | Model selection, context management |

## Available Agents

Located in `~/.claude/agents/`:

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| planner | Feature implementation planning |
| architect | System design and architecture |
| tdd-guide | Test-driven development |
| code-reviewer | Code review for quality/security |
| security-reviewer | Security vulnerability analysis |
| build-error-resolver | Build error resolution |
| e2e-runner | Playwright E2E testing |
| refactor-cleaner | Dead code cleanup |
| doc-updater | Documentation updates |

## Ask User Question

- Use Plan Mode for complex operations.
- Use the AskUserQuestion tool to repeatedly ask questions until all uncertainties are resolved.

## Subagents

When you completed a change with more than 3 files or 100 lines, you must always launch code-reviewer subagent.
  - When you updated multiple files, launch the subagents concurrently.
- When you updated security-related (auth*, security*, credential*) files, you must always launch security-auditor agent.

## Personal Preferences

### Privacy

- Always redact logs; never paste secrets (API keys/tokens/passwords/JWTs)
- Review output before sharing - remove any sensitive data

### Code Style

- No emojis in code, comments, or documentation
- Prefer immutability - make effort not to mutate objects or arrays
- Many small files over few large files
- 200-400 lines typical, 800 max per file
